# Web Development - Project II

This repository was made for a web development project, it is a functional shopping cart, hence the name Carto, within a landing page that shows a list of products requested from the Mercado Livre's API.
Due to many technical problems I followed a YouTube tutorial of this project instead of creating the design all on my own.
The tutorial repository can be found here: https://github.com/manualdodev/shopping-cart.

This project was developed for the Web Development Course sponsored by the Instituto Nu through the e-learning platform Descomplica, with the purpose of practicing my skills in JavaScript and ReactJS. 
The content of the website is in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).
